# Atlas Scientific Carrier Board

This repository has Gerber files and a KiCad file for an Atlas Scientific chip carrier board. Solder on female headers to plug in the sensor chips and inline voltage isolators. A grove socket can be soldered onto the top of the board to allow easy communication to Arduino-based data loggers using a grove cable. BNC connectors that connect to the sensors can be soldered on the bottom of the board, or use another three-pin connector. Three of these boards cost about $25 at https://oshpark.com/
