# Atlas Scientific Carrier Board

This repository has Gerber files and a KiCad file for an Atlas Scientific chip carrier board. This board was designed to work with a Mayfly data logger from https://www.envirodiy.org/. Solder on female headers to plug in the sensor chips and inline voltage isolators. Voltage isolators are necessary, but you could use some jumper wires if you don't want to use a voltage isolator. A grove socket can be soldered onto the top of the board to allow easy communication using a grove cable. BNC connectors that connect to the sensors directly can be soldered on the bottom of the board, or use another three-pin connector. Three of these boards cost about $25 at https://oshpark.com/.
